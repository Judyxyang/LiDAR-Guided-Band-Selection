# LiDAR-Guided-Band-Selection
Experiments Data of LiDAR Guided Cross Attention HSI Band  Selection for Classification
The code include: 
1. Augmented Houston 2013 Cross attention band selection code. 
2. Ablation Study code.
3. Classification for SVM, CNN
4. The experiments outcome might be having a little difference based on different hyperparameter settings. 
5.  Un2013 hyperspectral image datasets via Google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16dQvwMvMFDnzwdQrtRxeyIOoeAC820Yu?usp=drive_link
